In this group project I was responsible from game module. I write Snake game in JS and backend logic.
For authenticated users, the module allows them to play mini-games  and earn points. These points are used for character development. The user's best score and experience points earned daily are sent to the database.
Unauthenticated users can play the Snake game without saving or sending the score to the database.
